## Summary

Welcome to the design and development portfolio of Sean Caudill. Visit here: [seancaudill.com](https://seancaudill.com).

I'm developing my site using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). To test it out yourself just run `$ gulp` in the project's root directory.

## Stack

I'm developing the site leveraging the following technologies:

- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) & [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/): CLI development environment and package management
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): HTML/CSS/JS framework, front-end toolkit
- [Bootstrap NPM starter](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-npm-starter): template repo for using Bootstrap with NPM
	- Currently built using Bootstrap v4, so modifications were made to interact with v5
- [Cloudinary Media Optimizer](https://cloudinary.com/products/media_optimizer): Integrated image compression and optimization
- Google Analytics 4
